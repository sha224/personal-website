My name is Shakhar Dasgupta and I live in Rome, New York. I am currently working as a Software Engineer at [BAE Systems](https://www.baesystems.com/en-us/home). There, I work mostly on maintaining and developing various back-end services for [GXP Xplorer Platform](https://www.geospatialexploitationproducts.com/content/gxp-xplorer-platform/), a product which provides various military organizations around the world with Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT) capabilities. Due to the innovative nature of the product, I have also had the chance to work on various modern technologies related to Cloud and Enterprise Blockchain.

Before joining BAE Systems, I went to [State University of New York at Oswego](https://www.oswego.edu), where I got my Bachelor of Science degree in Software Engineering. There, I was able to learn from some of the brightest minds in Computer Science while also gaining leadership experiences by working as a Resident Assistant in the dorms.

Apart from my duties at work, I also like to learn and try new software tools and languages during my free time. When I am not coding, I like to go on long walks, watch TV shows or travel to new places.
